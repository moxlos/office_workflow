PROOF OF CONCEPT

The data:

    - The data is randomly generated.


The app is an interactive simulation tool designed to optimize and analyze workflow efficiency in an office or company setting. Users can configure the simulation by selecting the number of workers, defining products or procedures, and specifying the sequence of tasks each product must complete. Additionally, users can set time distributions for task completion to reflect real-world variability. The simulation generates a timeline plot to visualize task assignments and progress, logs each step of the process for detailed insights, and provides a comprehensive performance report with key metrics. A dashboard of summary analytics offers plots to help users understand task and product completion trends, worker utilization, and bottlenecks, enabling data-driven decision-making.
